Test Creation
=============

Instructions on how to create tests and how to use the cpp-client ``testeth`` tool
can be found in the c++ documentation
`test generation chapter <https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/blob/master/doc/generating_tests.rst>`_.

Since docker images pointed to in the test generation docs are often outdated, you will probably
have to rely on your own `source build <https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/#building-from-source>`_ of the Aleth C++
Ethereum client for generating tests (start this early on since this is taking some time).
